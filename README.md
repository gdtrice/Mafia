# Mafia
A mainly educational attempt to implement the RPG, Mafia using technologies/frameworks I'm interested in trying out.

Run locally:
- Navigate to /Applications/MongoDB
- Run ./mongod --dbpath ~/GitRepos/Mafia/mfnode/data
- In another terminal/screen navigate to ~GitRepos/Mafia/mfnode
- run npm start
- server should be running locally on http://localhost:3000/
